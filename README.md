* User info is saved in Redux store.

### **2. Browse Page**

* Shows new trailers and genre-based movie lists.
* Data is fetched from TMDB API and stored in Redux.

### **3. GPT Search Page**

* User types a query for very specific recommendations.
* Request goes to **Groq LLaMA-3 model**.
* Model returns results → stored in Redux.
* A follow-up request is sent to TMDB API for posters and movie details.
* Final movies are displayed beautifully on the page.
